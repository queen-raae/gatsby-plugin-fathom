## When Do You Use The Fathom Plugin?

I will tell you two stories, one story is aaalmost without pretend in it, but the first story is ALL pretend.

### A Story About a Pretend Personal Dev Blog
Weâ€™ll pretend you are doing some work on your personal dev blog.
What would happen if you stopped collecting gobs of personal data about your dev friends with google analytics?

Letâ€™s say you installed Benedicteâ€™s Fathom Plugin and gave google analytics a quick cat nap. Then you could open a single Fathom dashboard and at a glance see your top content. Pop! Pop! Into your head pops two good ideas for blog posts. You decide to go with Idea Number One, because your top content is right before your eyes and you just FEEL Idea Number One is better than Idea Number Two.

Why donâ€™t you take Benedicteâ€™s Fathom Plugin for a spin around your dev blog and make this little story true?


### A Story About Benedicte Using Fathom To Focus on Her Real Work And Not Being Distracted By Distracting Data
This time I will tell you a story aaalmost without pretend in it. A story about  developer-Benedicte using her own Fathom Plugin and I will tell you in advance what the pretend part is. This story is based on a real website. The website has a real product, POW! the bleh bleh. The product has real customers. Pretend Alert! I will give one of the real customers a fake identity, because â€¦. reasons. The fake identity is Princess Lizabeth (17), I hope you can handle a little sprinkle of glittery royalty ðŸ‘‘. ðŸ˜º If so, letâ€™s go!



### A Long Time Ago,
### By a Bridge Far, Far Away â€¦.

Princess Lizabeth (17) is sunning her white face and red hair on the pink deck of her sister smart little ship. Lizabeth is writing away in her end-to-end encrypted journal mostly about her menstrual cycles. But she is also writing about toxic relationships, like her hateful sister Mary. Now dear reader, instead of going into these powerfully personal details, I will urge you to ask yourself ONE question about data.

#### Question 1:
Â«Self, how much data is being reported back to developer-Benedicte by Fathom about  Princess Lizabethâ€™s current writing activity?Â»

#### Answer 1:
Â«Nothing.Â»
