# Fathom Analytics Gatsby Plugin

> Add Fathom Analytics to your Gatsby site with @raae/gatsby-plugin-fathom.

Instead of messing with [html.js as Fathom suggests](https://usefathom.com/integrations/gatsbyjs), use this plugin to add the Fathom tracking script the Gatsby way.

Gatsby Plugin Fathom exposes all the [advanced tracking options](https://usefathom.com/support/tracking-advanced) as plugin options.

## Fathom Analytics

> Fathom is a simple, light-weight, privacy-first alternative to Google Analytics. So, stop scrolling through pages of reports and collecting gobs of personal data about your visitors, both of which you probably donâ€™t need. Our website stats show up on a single, blazingly fast dashboard so you can make business decisions quickly.

From the [Fathom website](https://usefathom.com/).

## How to install

`npm install @raae/gatsby-plugin-fathom`

or

`yarn add @raae/gatsby-plugin-fathom`

## How to use

### Basic configuration

The only required option is _site_.

```
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: `@raae/gatsby-plugin-fathom`,
      options: {
        site: "<your fathom site id>",
      },
    },
  ],
}
```

Feel free to use my test site id "CNOZPPSE" and [check the dashboard](https://app.usefathom.com/share/cnozppse/testing) to see if your setup is correct.

### Advanced configuration

Learn more below and in Fathom's [advanced tracking options](https://usefathom.com/support/tracking-advanced) docs.
